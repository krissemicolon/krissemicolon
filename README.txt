I recently moved to a selfhosted
instance of gitea (git.devhub.art/krissemicolon).
All projects on my github are outdated.

New Location: git.devhub.art

New Organisation Locations:
github.com/space-lang     ->  git.devhub.art/space-lang
github.com/sigma-lang     ->  git.devhub.art/sigma-lang
github.com/corium-engine  ->  git.devhub.art/corium-engine
