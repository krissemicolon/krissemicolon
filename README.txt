I recently moved to a selfhosted
instance of gitea (devhub.ml/krissemicolon).
All projects on my github are outdated.

New Organisation Locations:
github.com/space-lang     ->  devhub.ml/space-lang
github.com/sigma-lang     ->  devhub.ml/sigma-lang
github.com/corium-engine  ->  devhub.ml/corium-engine
